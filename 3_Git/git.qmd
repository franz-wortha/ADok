## Scope

-   This section will focus on minimal basics to use git for version control
    -   Focus on a local git
    -   Commands strictly necessary to work on simple analysis projects
-   Reasons for this limitation
    -   GitHub requires an account
    -   Remote repositories are not necessarily compliant with data security and privacy restrictions
        -   Infrastructure varies by institution (e.g., locally hosted repositories)
    -   The integration of GitHub varies in most IDEs
-   This approach can be easily extended to remote repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)

## Git

-   Git is a version control tool
-   Mostly known through the remote repository GitHub
-   Tracks changes in files
    -   'Checkpoints' have to be manually set
    -   Mainly used for coding, can be used for documents as well (e.g., manuscripts)
-   Alternative branches can be created to test things
    -   Successful changes can be incorporated
    -   Failed tests can be disregarded without affecting the project

## Setting up Git

-   [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install git
    -   You can check if git is installed by typing `git` in in your shell
    -   This will show a brief overview of git functions

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git
```

-   Set your username and email
    -   This is not a log in/set up of an account
    -   Used to track who committed changes

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# Show username and email
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

## A Simplified Git Workflow

1.  Initialize git (only required when starting a new project)

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git init
```

2.  Work on project
3.  Add files for commit

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# Add specific files
git add script1.R script2.R script1.R
# Add all changed files to commit
git add .
```

4.  Commit changes

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git commit -m "Added demonstration scripts"
```

5.  Repeat 2-4

## Reverting an Erroneous Commit

1.  Get the commit hash of commit that broke project

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git log
```

2.  Revert all changes of that commit

-   This reversal is kept as a commit
-   Information for the breaking commit are kept in the version history

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git revert f07ceb7ab03b6b50d2f65c67b6cd8b280f0f2912
```

## Fixing Issues Before They are Committed

-   Realize issue before files are added changes are committed
    -   Revert uncommitted changes

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# Revert uncommitted changes to a specific file
git checkout -- file_that_broke_my_project.R
# Reverting all uncommitted changes
git checkout -- :/
```

## Testing on New Branches

1.  Make sure you are up to date
2.  Create new branch

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git branch trying_something_new
```

3.  Switch to New Branch

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git checkout trying_something_new
```

4.  Implement and test changes
5.  They don't work $\rightarrow$ switch to back main branch and delete branch

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git checkout main
git branch -d trying_something_new
```

5.  They work $\rightarrow$ switch to main branch and merge branches

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git checkout main
git merge trying_something_new
```

## Ignoring Files

-   You can tell to ignore files and folders
    -   These never show up in git status even if they are changed
-   This is achieved with the `.gitignore` file
    -   Files can be listed explicitly
    -   Patterns can be used to multiple files
        -   All files in a folder (data/\*\*)
        -   All files of a type (\*.sav)
-   `renv::dependencies` skips any file listed in `.gitignore`

# `Git` + `renv` exercise

# Setting up an R Analysis Project with RStudio

-   Open new project in the destination folder
    -   `File > New Project`
-   Initialize version control using git
-   Initialize renv for package management
    -   Check `git version control` and `use renv`
-   Install required packages
    -   Snapshot the package versions with renv
    -   Stage and commit changes to the renv using git
-   Set up the folder structure
-   Import required data
-   Start working on the project
